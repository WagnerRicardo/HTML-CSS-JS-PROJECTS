## Overview

This is a project that utilizes HTML+CSS+JS to build an application that generates a conference ticket based on the filling of a valid form.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I will begin by adjusting the HTML semantics, then use CSS and CSS-grid for the development of the layout based on the design references, and add functionality with Javascript, both for form input validation and treatment of the data input through the form.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
