# Frontend Mentor - Conference Ticket Generator

![Design preview for the Conference ticket generator coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/conference-ticket-generator-oq5gFIU12w) challenge!

It was built with accessibility, validation, and responsive design in mind. The project simulates a ticket generator for a developer conference, where users can fill out a form and receive a stylized ticket preview with their info.

## The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- Complete the form with their details
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - Any field is missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - The avatar upload is too big or the wrong image format
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, form field hints, and error messages announced on their screen reader
- See the generated conference ticket when they successfully submit the form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Features I implemented

- âœ… Real-time form validation (including accessibility feedback)
- âœ… Drag-and-drop or file input avatar upload with preview
- âœ… Screen reader support (ARIA live regions)
- âœ… sessionStorage to transfer form data between pages
- âœ… Ticket preview screen styled with user input
- âœ… Mobile-first, fully responsive layout

## Tech stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (flexbox & grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Live site

## What I learned

- Better understanding of accessible forms
- FileReader API for image previews
- How to handle form state and dynamic rendering without frameworks

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/conference-ticket-generator.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

> No build steps needed â€“ everything is static and ready to go!
